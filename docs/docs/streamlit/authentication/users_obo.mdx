# On-behalf-of-user authentication

This recipe demonstrates how to use Databricks Apps [on-behalf-of-user authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/app-development#-using-the-databricks-apps-authorization-model) to run a SQL query using the user's credentials instead of the app's service principal.

## Code snippet

```python title="app.py"
import streamlit as st
from databricks import sql
from databricks.sdk.core import Config

cfg = Config()

def get_user_token():
    headers = st.context.headers
    user_token = headers["X-Forwarded-Access-Token"]
    return user_token

@st.cache_resource
def connect_with_obo(http_path, user_token):
    return sql.connect(
        server_hostname=cfg.host,
        http_path=http_path,
        access_token=user_token
    )

def execute_query(table_name, conn):
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} LIMIT 10"
        cursor.execute(query)
        return cursor.fetchall_arrow().to_pandas()

user_token = get_user_token()

http_path = "/sql/1.0/warehouses/abcd1234"  # Replace with your SQL warehouse HTTP path
table_name = "samples.nyctaxi.trips"  # Replace with your catalog.schema.table

if st.button("Run Query"):
    conn = connect_with_obo(http_path, user_token)
    df = execute_query(table_name, conn)
    st.dataframe(df)
```

:::info

This sample uses Streamlit's [st.cache_resource](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/caching#stcache_resource) to cache the database connection across users, sessions, and reruns. The app will only work when deployed to Databricks Apps with on-behalf-of-user authentication enabled.

:::

:::warning

You need to enable [on-behalf-of-user authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/app-development#-using-the-databricks-apps-authorization-model) for your application for this sample to work. When running this code locally, the `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` will not be present and the sample will not work as intended.

## Resources

- [SQL warehouse](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/sql-warehouse/)
- [Unity Catalog table](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/tables/)

## Permissions

For the on-behalf-of-user authentication model, permissions work as follows:

- **User's permissions**: When using OBO authentication, the query runs with the end user's permissions
  - User needs `SELECT` permissions on the tables being queried
  - User needs `CAN USE` on the SQL warehouse

- **App service principal**: When falling back to service principal authentication
  - Needs `CAN USE` on the SQL warehouse
  - Needs `SELECT` on the Unity Catalog tables for fallback access

See [Databricks Apps authorization model](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/#how-does-databricks-apps-manage-authorization) for more information.
